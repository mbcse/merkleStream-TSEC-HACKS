Currently, there is no transparency in the way funds are transferred from the subscriber of a streaming service to the creator of the content, this can lead to services favouring some artists over others and small content creators being suppressed. Instead, if Digital Rights Management (DRM) is based on a Blockchain, then there could be transparency in payouts for all artists. This could be proportional to how often the track is played or for the duration of time the content is played. By making this based on smart contracts and codifying the deal, there will be lesser disputes based on contract clause wordings.
